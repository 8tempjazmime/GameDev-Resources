## How to Use Waves NLS Plugin in Your DAW
 
Waves NLS plugin consists of two components: NLS Channel and NLS Buss. The NLS Channel is designed to be inserted on individual tracks or buses, while the NLS Buss is meant to be inserted on the master buss or subgroups. The NLS Channel and NLS Buss work together to create the analog summing effect.
 
To use Waves NLS plugin in your DAW, follow these steps:

1. Insert the NLS Channel plugin on each track or bus that you want to process with analog summing. You can choose between three console models: Spike (SSL 4000G), Mike (EMI TG12345 Mk 4), or Nevo (Neve 5116). You can also select a specific channel number from each console, which will have a slightly different sound and behavior.
2. Adjust the Drive knob to control the amount of harmonic distortion and saturation added by the plugin. You can also use the Noise switch to add or remove analog noise, the Bypass switch to bypass the plugin processing, and the Mic switch to change the input impedance of the plugin.
3. Use the VCA Group controls to assign each track or bus to a VCA group. This will allow you to control the level and mute of multiple tracks or buses from a single NLS Buss plugin.
4. Insert the NLS Buss plugin on your master buss or subgroup. Make sure that the console model and VCA group match the ones you selected on the NLS Channel plugins. You can also use the Trim knob to adjust the output level of the plugin.
5. Use the VCA Group faders and mutes to control the level and mute of each VCA group. You can also solo each VCA group by holding down Ctrl (PC) or Command (Mac) and clicking on the mute button.

By using Waves NLS plugin on your tracks and buses, you can achieve a more cohesive and warm sound that resembles analog mixing consoles. You can experiment with different console models and channel numbers to find the best fit for your music genre and style.
